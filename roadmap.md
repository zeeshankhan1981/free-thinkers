## Claude 3.7 Development Commands

### Infrastructure Development

```bash
# Generate structured logging implementation
claude_code "Create a Python logging module for Flask that includes structured logging with different levels, log rotation, and configuration options. Include examples for how to log errors, warnings, and info messages."

# Create error handling system
claude_code "Develop a comprehensive error handling system for a Flask application with API endpoints. Include custom exception classes, error handlers for different types of errors, and proper error response formatting in JSON. Show an example of graceful degradation for model failures."

# Implement configuration management
claude_code "Design a config.py module for a Flask application that centralizes configuration, supports environment variables via python-dotenv, and includes validation logic. Include a schema for configuration validation and examples of configuration categories for a LLM chat application."
```

### UI/UX Development

```bash
# Create conversation management system
claude_code "Design a JavaScript module for managing named conversations in a chat application. Include functions for creating, naming, searching, and organizing conversations. Also provide code for exporting/importing conversations in both JSON and Markdown formats."

# Implement markdown and code rendering
claude_code "Create a JavaScript function that renders markdown in chat messages, with special handling for code blocks that includes syntax highlighting. Use a lightweight library and ensure it works with streamed responses."

# Develop accessibility features
claude_code "Enhance a chat application with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance features. Include keyboard shortcuts for common actions, proper ARIA attributes, and screen reader compatibility. Provide a comprehensive checklist of accessibility requirements and the code changes needed."
```

### Model Management

```bash
# Create model management UI
claude_code "Design a model management panel UI in HTML/CSS/JS that allows users to view available models, download new ones with progress indicators, and track model versions. Include the backend Flask routes needed to support these features."

# Implement parameter controls
claude_code "Develop a UI component for adjusting model parameters (temperature, top_p, top_k, etc.) with visual explanations of what each parameter does. Include presets for different types of responses (creative, precise, balanced) and the JavaScript to update these in real-time."

# Create token visualization
claude_code "Build a token counting and visualization system for LLM conversations. Include both frontend components to show token usage and backend logic to accurately count tokens for different models. Add a visualization of context window usage."
```

### Advanced Features

```bash
# Design plugin architecture
claude_code "Create a plugin architecture for a Flask-based LLM chat application. Include the core plugin interface, registration system, a sample web search plugin implementation, and the frontend components needed to interact with plugins."

# Implement RAG system
claude_code "Design a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for a Flask application. Include document upload handling, text extraction, vector database integration with FAISS or Chroma, and the API endpoints needed for semantic search and retrieval during chat."

# Build authentication system
claude_code "Implement a secure authentication and authorization system for a Flask application. Include user registration, login, password reset flows, role-based access control, and secure session management. Add multi-user support for shared conversations."
```

### Mobile & Deployment

```bash
# Optimize for mobile
claude_code "Enhance the CSS and JavaScript of a chat application for mobile responsiveness. Include media queries, touch-friendly interface elements, and PWA capabilities for offline access. Provide a service worker implementation for caching resources."

# Create Docker setup
claude_code "Develop a complete Docker setup for a Flask and Ollama-based chat application. Include Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml with proper networking, volume mounts for persistence, and environment variable configuration. Add instructions for deployment on different platforms."
```

### Documentation & Community

```bash
