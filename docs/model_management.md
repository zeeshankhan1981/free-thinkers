# Model Management and Parameter Controls

## Model Management

### Available Models
Free Thinkers supports multiple language models, each with its own strengths and characteristics. The available models are:

1. **Mistral-7B**
   - General-purpose model optimized for fast responses
   - Best for concise outputs and general tasks
   - Parameter settings:
     - Default temperature: 0.7
     - Default top_p: 0.95
     - Default top_k: 40

2. **LLaMA 3.2**
   - Balanced model for various tasks
   - Good for both creative and analytical tasks
   - Parameter settings:
     - Default temperature: 0.7
     - Default top_p: 0.9
     - Default top_k: 40

### Model Parameters

#### Temperature
- Controls the randomness of the model's output
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0
- Lower values (e.g., 0.2) make the output more deterministic and focused
- Higher values (e.g., 0.9) make the output more creative and varied
- Default: 0.7

#### Top P (Nucleus Sampling)
- Controls the diversity of the model's output by sampling from the top P% of the probability distribution
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0
- Lower values (e.g., 0.5) make the output more focused and deterministic
- Higher values (e.g., 0.9) make the output more diverse and creative
- Default: 0.95

#### Top K
- Controls the diversity of the model's output by sampling from the top K most likely tokens
- Range: 1 to 100
- Lower values (e.g., 10) make the output more focused and deterministic
- Higher values (e.g., 50) make the output more diverse and creative
- Default: 40

#### Repetition Penalty
- Controls how much the model penalizes repeated tokens
- Range: 1.0 to 2.0
- Lower values (e.g., 1.0) allow more repetition
- Higher values (e.g., 1.5) discourage repetition
- Default: 1.1

#### Context Window
- Controls the maximum number of tokens the model can remember
- Range: 1024 to 4096
- Lower values (e.g., 1024) make the model faster but with less context
- Higher values (e.g., 4096) make the model slower but with more context
- Default: 2048

## Preset Settings

### Creative Mode
- Temperature: 0.8
- Top P: 0.9
- Top K: 50
- Repetition Penalty: 1.1
- Context Window: 2048
- Best for: Creative writing, story generation, brainstorming

### Balanced Mode
- Temperature: 0.7
- Top P: 0.95
- Top K: 40
- Repetition Penalty: 1.1
- Context Window: 2048
- Best for: General tasks, question answering, summarization

### Precise Mode
- Temperature: 0.6
- Top P: 0.8
- Top K: 30
- Repetition Penalty: 1.2
- Context Window: 2048
- Best for: Technical writing, code generation, factual tasks

## Best Practices

1. **Temperature**
   - Use lower values (0.2-0.4) for tasks requiring accuracy and consistency
   - Use higher values (0.7-0.9) for creative tasks and brainstorming
   - Avoid extreme values (0.0 or 1.0) as they can lead to either repetitive or nonsensical output

2. **Top P and Top K**
   - Use together to control output diversity
   - For more focused output, use lower values for both
   - For more creative output, use higher values for both
   - Start with default values and adjust based on specific needs

3. **Repetition Penalty**
   - Increase for tasks requiring varied output
   - Decrease for tasks where repetition is acceptable
   - Too high values can lead to unnatural output

4. **Context Window**
   - Increase for tasks requiring long context
   - Decrease for faster responses with less context
   - Balance based on specific task requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Repetitive Output**
   - Increase repetition penalty
   - Decrease temperature
   - Adjust top P and top K

2. **Incoherent Output**
   - Decrease temperature
   - Adjust top P and top K
   - Increase context window

3. **Slow Responses**
   - Decrease context window
   - Use balanced or precise preset
   - Check system resources

### Performance Tips

1. **GPU Acceleration**
   - Ensure GPU acceleration is enabled in settings
   - Monitor GPU usage
   - Adjust parameters for optimal performance

2. **Resource Management**
   - Monitor system memory usage
   - Adjust context window based on available resources
   - Consider reducing parameters for resource-constrained environments

## Advanced Usage

### Parameter Optimization

1. **Task-Specific Tuning**
   - Creative writing: Higher temperature, top P, and top K
   - Technical tasks: Lower temperature, repetition penalty 1.2-1.5
   - Summarization: Balanced settings with moderate repetition penalty

2. **Context Management**
   - Use smaller context windows for focused tasks
   - Use larger context windows for context-dependent tasks
   - Consider splitting long tasks into smaller chunks

3. **Output Quality Control**
   - Use repetition penalty to control output diversity
   - Adjust temperature for desired output style
   - Fine-tune top P and top K for specific output characteristics

## Model Selection Guidelines

1. **Mistral-7B**
   - Best for: Fast responses, general tasks, concise outputs
   - Use when: Speed is important, results need to be quick
   - Avoid when: Need highly technical or specialized output

2. **LLaMA 3.2**
   - Best for: Balanced performance, general-purpose tasks
   - Use when: Need balanced performance between speed and quality
   - Avoid when: Need extremely fast responses or specialized tasks
