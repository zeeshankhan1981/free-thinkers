# Free Thinkers Architecture

## System Overview

Free Thinkers is a local-first language model chat interface designed to run efficiently on Apple Silicon Macs. The system architecture is optimized for performance, scalability, and user experience.

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- HTML5/CSS3 with modern UI components
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- WebSocket for real-time communication
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities

### Backend
- Python 3.13+ with Flask
- Ollama integration for model management
- SQLite for persistent storage
- RESTful API architecture

## Component Architecture

### Frontend Components

#### UI Layer
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Custom components for model management
- Real-time progress indicators
- PWA features (offline support, push notifications)

#### State Management
- Local storage for persistent settings
- Session management
- Model state tracking
- Conversation history

### Backend Components

#### API Layer
- RESTful endpoints for model management
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Error handling and validation
- Rate limiting

#### Model Management
- Dynamic model discovery
- Model categorization by family
- Parameter optimization
- Usage statistics tracking

#### Storage Layer
- SQLite for persistent data
- Local file system for model storage
- Cache layer for performance
- Session management

## Data Flow

### Model Management Flow
1. User initiates model download
2. API fetches model metadata
3. Download starts with progress tracking
4. Model is installed and cached
5. Parameters are optimized
6. Model becomes available for use

### Chat Flow
1. User sends message
2. API processes request
3. Model generates response
4. Response is streamed back
5. Conversation history is updated
6. Statistics are tracked
